In this assignment you will write smallsh your own shell in C. smallsh will implement a command line interface similar to well-known shells, such as bash. 
Your program will:

Print an interactive input prompt
Parse command line input into semantic tokens
Implement parameter expansion
Shell special parameters $$, $?, and $!
Tilde (~) expansion
Implement two shell built-in commands: exit and cd
Execute non-built-in commands using the the appropriate EXEC(3) function.
Implement redirection operators ‘<’ and ‘>’
Implement the ‘&’ operator to run commands in the background
Implement custom behavior for SIGINT and SIGTSTP signals
